Conclusion from project:
+ The Western region with states like California , Colorado and Michigan lead the country with highest number of Breweries.  This is possibly due to a better climate in the western region.
+ Unlike states like Utah where ABV is regulated to 5%, we can utilize western states to manufacture a product with a higher ABV.
+ California would be the most optimum possibility for us in deciding a product with a high ABV and most suitable climate.
+ IBU is not as high in California in consideration to states like Maine.
